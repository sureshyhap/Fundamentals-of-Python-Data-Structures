It partitions an array such that all elements to the left of some pivot position
is less than or equal to it and all elements to the right of it are greater than
or equal to it. Then it recursively does the same process on all subarray division.

It is O(N log N) because there will be about O(log N) partitioning steps and for each
there is a search through the array to find elements that belong before or after the
pivot which is O(N). So multiplying results in O(N log N).
